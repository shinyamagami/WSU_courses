# WSUInPerson

Welcome to WSU_In_Person gem!

All non "WEB ARR" classes are in the csv file.
Please run "ruby main.rb" when you want a newer csv file.
I am not sure the definitions of in-person class and WEB ARR classes.
So please don't trust this list.

<!--
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'WSU_In_Person'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install WSU_In_Person

-->

## Usage


Run "ruby main.rb" and it display the list of in-person classes.
It only exclude "WEB ARR" classes and I am not sure if it is counted as in-person or not yet. Any classes with "ARR ARR" or a room location will be displayed, I believe.
